<h2>About this Visualization</h2>
<h4>Changes in house size and affordability over a 90-year span</h4>
<p></p>
<p><i>Structure</i></p>
<p>I chose to use the interactive slideshow format for my visualization. 
Since the two slides are showing somewhat different aspects of this housing story, 
this was a better fit than the martini glass or drill-down methods. 
This visualization includes two scenes, each with their own annotations, paramenters, and triggers.</p>

<p><i>Scene 1: Houses Built</i></p>

<p>In the first scene, you have a bar graph. When the page loads, there is a 1-second delay before
the bars transition from their initial positions to their proper lengths. The decade label is always on
from the initial page load, but the total number of homes built in the decade does not appear until 
after the bars have reached their full lengths. The percentage breakdown for the number of bedrooms
per house for each decade can be seen by mousing over each bar. This is removed once the mouse moves 
off the bar. (I know the label isn't very pretty - I couldn't get it to make a mini graph like I was 
trying for... Future goals for me!)</p>
<p>The question in the header is intended to prompt the reader to interact with the graph. By having 
he label pop up from just hovering, I don't have to hope that the reader thinks to click on the bars - 
they automatically get more information just by moving around.</p>
<p>The "lightgreen" color was chosen because it is similar to colors used for high contrast settings to help
those with visual impairments. Using the thin border helps make the bars more distinct with such a bright 
color. The labels are in a white box with a thin border and black font for the same reason.</<p>

<p><i>Scene 2: Financial Burden</i></p>

<p>In the second scene, you have a line graph. When the page loads, there is a 1-second delay before
the points transition from their initial positions to their proper heights. The decade label remains
at the bottom from the beginning. The financial burden (percentage of overall income) can be seen
by hovering the mouse over each point. The financial burden label is removed once the mouse moves off
the point. Since the line only respresents the general trend between points, a label tracing the line
would be inappropriate here.</p>
<p>The explanation of financial burden in the header is intended to prompt the reader to interact with 
the visualization. Since there are no numbers automatically shown to answer the question of financial burden 
it is not immediately clear what the scale of the graph is. Hopefully this spurs some curiosity. Clearly the 
value has been changing over time, but without a scale the reader must explore to find out if the range is 
from 0 to 10, 0 to 100, 30 to 80, who knows? =)</p>
<p>The color choice here is to stay visually consistent with that of the first scene as well as the same 
reasoning as I explained above regarding visual impairments. (And let's be honest - we're all tired of 
"steelblue"!)</p>
